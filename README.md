# Largest-Power-of-Two
The goal of the program is to find the largest power of 2 that is equal to or smaller than the value entered by the user. 
The idea behind this project was to get used to function calling when coding in MIPs. 

To run the program, download the .asm file Problem2 and open and run using QTSpim.
The Console should pop up asking to enter a number. Enter a number and press enter. The program returns the largest power of two that fits.
